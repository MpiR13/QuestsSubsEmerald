The blockchain is a public ledger of shared (database info on blocks instead of tables) that keeps immutable data time stamped in 'blocks' that connect to one another using hash cryptography to ensure that each block is truthful and trusted based on the previous blocks by a peer-to-peer system of decentralized nodes where multiple user solve complicated mathmatical equations to solidify each transaction that cannot be altered, deleted or destroyed.

2.Explain what a Smart Contract is. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts

Answer 2.. Smart contracts are designed by developers to follow a certain set of guidelines that once implemented will react by taking in certain sets of data for which the function asks for , then saves and stores this data, then sends all this updated information to the blockchain. They are simple programs that execute only when these predetermined rules are met and then stored on the chain. They automate once the agreement is met by all parties, are fast, secure and lets every participant know when the condtions are met without the need for a third party and happens almost immediately. 

3.Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

Answer 3.. A script is a 'free' set of commands used to automate actions or tasks within a program whereas a transaction is a PAID function that changes data on the blockchain and therefore cost money.
